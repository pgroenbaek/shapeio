This Python module provides functions to decode MSTS/ORTS shape files into Python objects and to encode them back into the shape file format. The API is very similar to that of the `json` module.

When modifying shapes using this module, there are no built-in safeguards beyond the structure of the data itself. If you don't know what you're doing, your changes may result in invalid shape files that won't work with Open Rails or MSTS.

List of companion modules:
- [shapecompress](https://github.com/pgroenbaek/shapecompress) - handles compression and decompression of shape files through the `TK.MSTS.Tokens.dll` library by Okrasa Ghia.
- [shapeedit](https://github.com/pgroenbaek/shapeedit) - provides a wrapper for modifying the shape data structure safely.
- [trackshape-utils](https://github.com/pgroenbaek/trackshape-utils/tree/develop) - offers additional utilities for working with track shapes.


## Installation

The Python module itself can be installed in the following ways:

<!-- ### Install from PyPI

```sh
pip install --upgrade shapeio
```

### Install from wheel

If you have downloaded a `.whl` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/pgroenbaek/shapeio/releases) page, install it with:

```sh
pip install path/to/shapeioâ€‘<version>â€‘py3â€‘noneâ€‘any.whl
```

Replace `<version>` with the actual version number in the filename. For example:

```sh
pip install path/to/shapeio-0.5.0b0-py3-none-any.whl
``` -->

### Install from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pgroenbaek/shapeio.git
pip install --upgrade ./shapeio
```

## Usage

### Load a shape from a file

To load a shape from disk, use the `shapeio.load` function. Note that the shape file must be uncompressed beforehand. Otherwise, you will get a `ShapeCompressedError`. See the [shapecompress](https://github.com/pgroenbaek/shapecompress) module for instructions on how to decompress a shape.

```python
import shapeio

my_shape = shapeio.load("./path/to/example.s")

print(my_shape)
```

### Save a shape to a file

To save a shape to disk, you can use the `shapeio.dump` function. This will serialize the shape object, including any changes made to it, into the structured text format and save it to the specified path.

```python
import shapeio

shapeio.dump(my_shape, "./path/to/output.s")
```

### Serialize a shape to a string

If you want to serialize the object into a string without saving it to a file on disk, you can use `shapeio.dumps`.

```python
import shapeio

shape_string = shapeio.dumps(my_shape)
print(shape_string)
```

### Parse a shape from a string

Similarly, you can use `shapeio.loads` to parse a shape from a string instead of reading it from a file on disk.

```python
import shapeio

shape_text = """
SIMISA@@@@@@@@@@JINX0s1t______

shape (
	shape_header ( 00000000 00000000 )
	volumes ( 12
		vol_sphere (
			vector ( -1.23867 3.5875 40 ) 42.452
		)
		vol_sphere (
			vector ( -1.23867 0.495151 40 ) 40.1839
		)
        ...
"""
shape = shapeio.loads(shape_text)
```

### Accessing shape data

The functions that load shapes return a `Shape` object, allowing you to access all the data defined in the shape file.

To explore the full data structure, see [shape.py](/shapeio/shape.py). You can also print the objects to view their attributes.

```python
import shapeio

my_shape = shapeio.load("./path/to/example.s")

# Print the point at index 17.
print(my_shape.points[17])

# Iterate over uv_points, print uv_point at index 10.
for idx, uv_point in enumerate(my_shape.uv_points):
    if idx == 10:
        print(uv_point)
```

### Modifying shape data

You can modify values, add or remove items from lists, and reorder items in the lists. The serialized shape data will reflect any changes you make.

```python
import shapeio
from shapeio import shape

my_shape = shapeio.load("./path/to/example.s")

# Modify an existing point.
my_shape.points[1].x = 17

# Add a new uv_point.
new_uv_point = shape.UVPoint(0.2, 0.5)
my_shape.uv_points.append(new_uv_point)

shapeio.dump(my_shape, "./path/to/output.s")
```

When using this module on its own, there are no built-in safeguards beyond the structure of the data itself to ensure that modifications will result in a shape usable in MSTS or Open Rails. See [shapeedit](https://github.com/pgroenbaek/shapeedit) for a wrapper that allows you to perform complex operations on the data structure safely.

However, the module does ensure that list counts in the serialized data are correct. It also enforces strict type checking during serialization, preventing you from adding items to lists and setting values of attributes that are not of the expected type.

For example, if you attempt to add a `shape.UVPoint` to the `points` list, a TypeError will be raised when you try to serialize the shape.

## Running Tests

You can run tests manually or use `tox` to test across multiple Python versions.

### Run Tests Manually
First, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install pytest
pip install pytest-dependency
```

Then, run tests with:

```sh
pytest
```


## Run Tests with `tox`

`tox` allows you to test across multiple Python environments.

### **1. Install `tox`**
```sh
pip install tox
```

### **2. Run Tests**
```sh
tox
```

This will execute tests in all specified Python versions.

### **3. `tox.ini` Configuration**
The `tox.ini` file should be in your project root:

```ini
[tox]
envlist = py36, py37, py38, py39, py310

[testenv]
deps = pytest
commands = pytest
```

Modify `envlist` to match the Python versions you want to support.
